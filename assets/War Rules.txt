Click the top of your deck to play your top card against the opponent’s card.  
The player with the higher card collects both cards and they are placed into 
a separate win pile.  If the cards are of the same rank, a War is initiated.  
During a War, each player plays three cards face down on top of the played card 
and one card face-up.  The card that is face-up will be compared to the opponent’s 
face-up card and the player with the higher ranked card will collect all the cards 
in the War.  If the cards are of the same rank, the War process is repeated until 
a player wins the War.  When a player runs out of cards, their win pile will be 
shuffled, and they will continue to play with those cards.  When a player 
completely runs out of cards, the game is over, and the other player wins.

The ranks in increasing order are as follows:  2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A
	(The suit of the card is disregarded)
